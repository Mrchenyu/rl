# ratelimit use to control user rate

# for this demo just test tc rules true or not

# before we need htb sfq ifb those modules

# then we add class and filter for each node,in here use mac filter

# use ifb to redirect so we needn't drop packet to control trafic

# use sfq to average packet for each node

# can use iperf or ixchariot to validate

# in the next can use ip filter and iptables do other experiment
